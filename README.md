# IPL Win Predictor

Predict the outcome of Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches using machine learning!

## Introduction

This project aims to predict the outcome of IPL cricket matches based on various in-game factors using a machine learning model. It takes into consideration the batting and bowling teams, host city, runs left, balls left, wickets, and other match statistics to estimate the probability of a team winning.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.


## Dependencies
The following libraries are required for this project:

* NumPy
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
  
--> You can install them using the following command:

* pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
  
 ## Installation :

1.Clone this repository to your local machine:

Copy code

git clone https://github.com/your-username/ipl-cricket-prediction.git

2.Navigate to the project directory:

Copy code

cd ipl-cricket-prediction

3.Download the necessary dataset files (matches.csv and deliveries.csv) and place them in the project directory.

4.Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to preprocess the data, train the model, and generate predictions.

## Usage: 

* Follow these steps to use the project effectively:

1.Make sure you have the required dependencies installed (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib).

2.Prepare the dataset files (matches.csv and deliveries.csv) and place them in the project directory.

3.Execute the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions.

## Project Structure:

* The project directory is organized as follows:

1.README.md: This document, providing project details and instructions.

2.matches.csv: A dataset containing match information.

3.deliveries.csv: A dataset containing ball-by-ball details.

4.ipl_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing code for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.

5.pipe.pkl: The trained model saved using pickle.

6.sample_output.png: A sample output graph depicting match progression.

## Algorithm :

* The core of this project involves the following steps:

1.Data Preprocessing: The historical match and delivery data are read and merged. Preprocessing includes handling missing values and transforming categorical features.

2.Feature Engineering: Key features such as the current score, runs left, wickets in hand, and more are calculated to provide input for the prediction model.

3.Model Training: The project employs a logistic regression algorithm. One-hot encoding is used for categorical features. The model is trained using historical match data.

4.Outcome Prediction: The trained model predicts the outcome of a match's second inning based on input features.

## Results :

The accuracy of the model on the test set is calculated and displayed, giving insights into its predictive performance. A function is included to visualize the match progression graphically.
